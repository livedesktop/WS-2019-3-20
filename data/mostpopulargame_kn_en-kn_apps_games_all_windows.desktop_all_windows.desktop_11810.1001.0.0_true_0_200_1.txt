In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games.

No pop-up or full-screen ads. Provide best user experience.\r\n\r\nThe classic game of whist is a plain-trick game without bidding for 4 players in fixed partnerships. There are four players in two fixed partnerships. Partners sit facing each other. A standard 52 card pack is used. The cards in each suit rank from highest to lowest: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.\r\n\r\nThe player to the dealer's left leads to the first trick. Any card may be led. The other players, in clockwise order, each play a card to the trick. Players must follow suit by playing a card of the same suit as the card led if they can; a player with no card of the suit led may play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump in it - or if it contains no trump, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\r\n\r\nWhen all 13 tricks have been played, the side which won more tricks scores 1 point for each trick they won in excess of 6. The partnership which first reaches 7 points wins the game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NQPFF95T6LV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Word Connect - Word Cookies","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20041.13769980214363025.3dd3a377-2d9e-4957-96c2-3305c7c024f1.73a0be4b-8720-4959-bbd1-3a7d75167e3b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2866.13769980214363025.44d99f77-a0a6-4145-b385-63c0d44ab655.cfb85f57-4332-4653-8756-117905ebaf08","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20041.13769980214363025.3dd3a377-2d9e-4957-96c2-3305c7c024f1.73a0be4b-8720-4959-bbd1-3a7d75167e3b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["4262TopFreeGamesCOC.WordConnect-WordCookies_j60m5ry1xpqh8"],"ContentIds":["e68be3ab-fad1-7d21-3286-b8b04592813d","b040f3c9-0fd4-7158-f794-537afa70ff4f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"World's best words puzzle game Word Connect - Word Cookies!\r\n\r\nWord Cookies - Word Friends is a very fun and exciting word puzzle game, it makes you keep playing for FREE!\r\n\r\nThe aim of the game is to find all hidden words.\r\nWith this game you can easily improve your vocabulary, concentration and spelling skills.\r\n\r\nThe KING of BRAIN TEASERS!\r\nDo you enjoy the word puzzle games as scrabble, crosswords, wordscapes, word cookies or word search or words with friends?

As any other successful game, millions of Solitaire clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with many card laouts in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe game starts with a specific layout and one open card. Rest of the cards are on closed stack. Your aim is to move all the cards to open card. \r\n- You can move any of the open card on the three peaks to the open card if it is adjacent to it regardless of the suit. e.g. you can move a 3 or 5 in case the open card is 4. Either King or 2 can go on top of the Ace (and vice versa). \r\n- If you are unable to move any card you can open a close card. \r\n- Every time you move a card from layout to open card you get points. These points start with 1 for the first time and increase by 1 for subsequent cards. However if you open a close card the streak breaks and the point start from 1 again. Earn bonus points for left over closed cards or for fast finish.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N273G1X5N66","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Words N Landscapes","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53044.13961629512024677.149560e8-f679-499d-b3cc-661d29195984.efb0cf9d-2d7b-4915-a0ca-4a13235b9116","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20447.13961629512024677.88257d3f-2903-48ff-a7a6-0c97190bd0be.b2842be0-2bae-4be7-bed7-62e642a95e1d","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51533.13961629512024677.5e803123-9f6c-4972-9e3f-a2bb109a264a.14137304-c41a-4630-b51b-6f22cd9894a5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36323.13961629512024677.956cd136-322e-42aa-adef-51cb34079b80.1cb4f233-ef48-45a1-bd55-89b0b2f546f1","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24723.13961629512024677.9273a9cd-93d1-4e39-b048-12314bab3028.73bfeb23-0702-436d-9049-0eded9330095","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56781.13961629512024677.9273a9cd-93d1-4e39-b048-12314bab3028.ec599580-1f2c-4692-8c58-bd48b2b28d0d","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57689.13961629512024677.896aba56-9c5d-4af9-af3c-e985f0a8dfc6.1045a18a-6be8-4356-8af1-fdb9ed55acd4","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3600.13961629512024677.878254fd-1e5e-433e-8cf6-48eec43c28ba.f7c3053e-a143-4242-9b97-2da7fb24bdac","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19482.13961629512024677.d64c85dd-5ed0-4e31-9fe5-2c8128166123.216c755d-84d5-45ed-ad9a-d62049486da8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51533.13961629512024677.5e803123-9f6c-4972-9e3f-a2bb109a264a.14137304-c41a-4630-b51b-6f22cd9894a5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["1727Riz.Wordscapes_yyvbx0pk3r5fr"],"ContentIds":["7f9093d3-fa74-23a6-1b5a-757874300fad","d31cf330-5a19-4095-4149-b8f93fa566c6","0919c3ed-a7f2-b633-fe44-548e23812348"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Enjoy word search and crosswords?
