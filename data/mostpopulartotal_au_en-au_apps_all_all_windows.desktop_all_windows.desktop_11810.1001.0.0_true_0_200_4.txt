The beautiful design and peaceful music create an amazing atmosphere that allows everybody, including children, to improve their typing skills and get TYPING FINGERS DIPLOMA after  successful completion of all levels.\r\n\r\n*** SYMMETRIC SUPER LEARNING ***\r\nTyping Fingers uses a modern teaching approach based on brain analysis. The SYMETRIC method helps to activate both  brain hemispheres equally in the process of learning and playing the game. The user maps the keyboard symmetrically and symmetrical patterns are repeated again and again during the whole game.\r\n\r\n*** GET A TYPING FINGERS DIPLOMA *** \r\nWin the game and get Foriero's Typing Fingers diploma! You can get exactly the same diploma as you see on the screen shots except with your name and date of game completion. Just print it and stick it on the wall and everybody, even you, will be proud that you have successfully completed TYPING FINGERS.\r\n\r\n*** 32 LEVELS WITH INTERACTIVE TUTOR ***\r\n(In-App Purchase is required for 31 of levels) \r\nIn all the 32 lessons a \"Tutor\" called \"Dennis\" will help you to learn which fingers are for striking which keys. The levels are built up gradually, so you learn how to use your keyboard in a fun and easy way.\r\n\r\n*** LEARNING AND PLAYING MODE ***\r\nEach lesson is divided into two parts. The first one is for learning purposes. In this part Dennis helps you to memorize letters and symbols and to practise the correct motion.\r\n\r\nThe second part is a game and you have \"ONLY\" three lives to beat the level. Work diligently, ardently and persistently and you´ll get it!\r\n\r\n*** WRITE US ***\r\nIf you have any ideas or notions or just feelings on how to improve this\r\napp you can always press the WRITE US button in the game and send us your feedback and wishes. We will be very glad to incorporate all your input into a new version.\r\n\r\nThank

A scoreboard is maintained which kid can see after each game. When kid scores enough points, he/she earns a sticker of his/her choice. All his/her earned stickers are kept in a box which he/she can relish any time they want later.\r\n\r\nWe have put our every effort to make this app interesting and beautiful.

Vince’s adventure takes him from the streets of New Orleans to the depths of a Louisiana bayou to find the whereabouts of his keeper, Madam Charmaine.\r\n\r\nIn true voodoo style, Vince encounters and defeats quirky monsters and villains ... by kicking his own butt! By racing under a falling safe, jumping into a high-speed blender, or leaping under falling rubble, Vince is sure to defeat his enemies—all while managing to escape completely unscathed.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n• Voodoo combat action: Players can employ more than 30 voodoo attacks that do outrageous things to Vince, but it's the monsters who end up hurting! Unlike in other games, players must actually USE dangers and hazards, instead of running from them. Falling safes, prickly pushpins, and bolts of lightning bring a whole new meaning to the phrase \"no pain, no gain.\" \r\n\r\n• Magical voodoo world: Thrust into the depths of a twisted and dangerous world, Vince must trek through 30 detailed levels, including crawfish-laden swamps, a graveyard filled with imps and lost zombies, a fantastic French Quarter, and a network of boggy sewers. \r\n\r\n• Vehicles and minigames: As the game unfolds, Vince must master and pilot a number of vehicles, including a fanboat, a submarine, an airplane—and even a rat gives him a lift at one point. Vince must master one mind-bending minigame after another to complete his quest. \r\n\r\n• Dynamic cast of characters: No adventure would be complete without its host of surly characters. Offbeat creatures with all the charm of New Orleans are around every corner. Vince encounters everything from Ginger Dead Men (who are not exactly sugar-coated) to a pair of intoxicated gas pumps that offer up a fiery challenge.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Play Anywhere: yours to play on both Xbox One and Windows 10 PC at no additional cost.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Live features including earning achievements and sharing game clips.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PN7T3JFPRZ6","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"My Dell","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3447.14353411462987863.c958a3f7-5738-4d29-9220-38e0f3071613.e395182c-45da-4b92-a376-115fa15e24a1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#007DB8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25234.14353411462987863.c958a3f7-5738-4d29-9220-38e0f3071613.f5ace06d-bd66-45d2-8a0b-720f7dca96ee","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#007DB8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36697.14353411462987863.c958a3f7-5738-4d29-9220-38e0f3071613.d9e04e90-29d6-4202-8239-e74fe2a2ff8a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#007DB8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13151.14353411462987863.c958a3f7-5738-4d29-9220-38e0f3071613.bc6cdc9d-28d5-4dc9-ac31-0a6449e67cd0","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#007DB8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49032.14353411462987863.c958a3f7-5738-4d29-9220-38e0f3071613.ab0b62f0-65c1-4999-b66a-85003e8d6481","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#007DB8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35949.14353411462987863.c958a3f7-5738-4d29-9220-38e0f3071613.db6368ef-cdac-4274-96d2-ac9c96bf5f23","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#007DB8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64711.14353411462987863.c958a3f7-5738-4d29-9220-38e0f3071613.4d53d80c-7e31-4cf0-a4b6-16ef6da9c16c","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#007DB8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43557.14353411462987863.c958a3f7-5738-4d29-9220-38e0f3071613.ecc4bffb-17aa-4495-bbc8-5e70c4b55e28","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#007DB8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4799.14353411462987863.c958a3f7-5738-4d29-9220-38e0f3071613.4d1182b2-b2c0-4c03-a5b1-145fdf163a71","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#007DB8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["DellInc.MyDell_htrsf667h5kn2"],"ContentIds":["a9faaaf3-c8fe-1b3a-07c0-822d3ccb4178","223253dc-8af2-f824-d4c6-9d7316e40205"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"\"Available on Dell XPS, Inspiron, G Series and Vostro PCs purchased in September 2018 or later.

Just select an audio file, mark the region you want to play (and loop/repeat) and change tempo and pitch on the fly. It is also possible to export the changed audio file for playback with other music players. \r\nUse cases of Music Speed Changer are for instance: practicing guitar and other music instruments (guitar, piano, etc.), transcriptions, change the speed of audiobooks, language learning...\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Change pitch and tempo (speed, time-stretch) independently\r\n- Loop region\r\n- Select region\r\n- Import various formats including mp3, wav, mp4, ...\r\n- Export modified sound to wav file\r\n- Volume amplification\r\n- Play left/right channels separately (e.g. for duet training)\r\n- Voice/Vocals reduction: reduce vocals so that only music is audible (does not work with all audio recordings!)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n- Extreme pitch and tempo changes (for instance 24 semi-tones, which is quite a lot!) can lead to noise.\r\n- For best experience, audio files should be located in the Windows \"Music\" document folder.\r\n\r\nQuestions, ideas, feedback?

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

rules, local prescriptions, case books and guidance documents. \r\n\r\nThe key difference to any other digital rules product is the 'Integrated eBook'. It cleverly links all the documents together and will incorporate the translated text of any participating country when it becomes available. \r\n\r\nWith the Integrated eBook, you can very quickly identify any case relevant to a particular rule, search for specific cases or even a case that may be associated to a text search.\r\n\r\nA rules mode in the settings allows the Integrated eBook to display Windsurfing, Team, Match, Radio or Kiteboard Racing amendments for your convenience.\r\n\r\nThere are also useful features such as pop-ups for all definitions where they are referenced in the text; this helps refer back to the detail of the definition without navigating off the page.\r\n\r\nThis app will be updated regularly with content as it becomes available through World Sailing or participating countries.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N2D89VMF47G","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Logo Maker with Graphic Design and Ads Designer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5871.13958550714983263.a6723725-6663-48cb-8c29-d7b77968599e.65bcf3af-70ab-4f72-a01f-22c9c65351a3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#009792","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40850.13958550714983263.a6723725-6663-48cb-8c29-d7b77968599e.2cf3101e-7d7e-4910-9939-d31590dc8499","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#009792","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22611.13958550714983263.a6723725-6663-48cb-8c29-d7b77968599e.2c5c69c0-10e0-45ed-9047-b9917366f110","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#009792","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17336.13958550714983263.a6723725-6663-48cb-8c29-d7b77968599e.66e88058-97d0-4cbe-801d-4b0e717a3171","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#009792","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37984.13958550714983263.a6723725-6663-48cb-8c29-d7b77968599e.fef5a5ea-fb9f-41be-9d35-e83e18ad2498","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#009792","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4145.13958550714983263.a6723725-6663-48cb-8c29-d7b77968599e.89005b15-eff6-489b-a6ce-e1fef4dee14d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#009792","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14204.13958550714983263.a6723725-6663-48cb-8c29-d7b77968599e.b2bb658f-cd30-4de0-886e-87f59c5db81d","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31647.13958550714983263.a6723725-6663-48cb-8c29-d7b77968599e.02925488-ef2b-4d89-bac9-bfab6e131aab","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7484.13958550714983263.a6723725-6663-48cb-8c29-d7b77968599e.82747b09-6eb9-42f8-a4eb-ee640eb5ae2a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#009792","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["40119PurpleMartin.LogoMakerwithGraphicDesignandAds_mmpkerhr368vt"],"ContentIds":["81c8cb29-9ca8-2b71-cdbc-5799ae2b39ac","c5a08bd3-6606-138a-361f-96c3a2d16317"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Create your very own professional & unique logo in just seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nLogo Maker with Graphic Design and Ads Designer is a fully loaded Logo Designer App to create Professional, Unique and Impressive logos on your windows phone and Desktop.\r\n\r\nLogo Maker with Graphic Design and Ads Designer is a fast and easy to use app with lots of Arts, Colors, Background & Textures.The App comes with all professional photo editing tools to create a professional LOGO.

In-app purchase is required to remove this limit.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZMQSP","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Font Candy - Typography Photo Editor","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.12960.13510798883392466.cd9cffb5-1fc7-49d4-9b4b-25b7364e9da9.2a7075ee-124f-40e9-b9e2-429c82c73f1b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#212121","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.46743.13510798883392466.bf13297d-3a70-4f92-add5-d4ad9e447329.6fc3cef4-6159-4867-9098-30c3e77538f9","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#212121","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.17882.13510798883392466.7841aa72-40ed-484b-a496-aa196b45923f.20d5ea97-d828-4073-97ff-d26593e637e8","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#212121","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.60381.13510798883392466.2356cfc0-6d8b-43f5-9be3-50f89d9c2f93.fec2376d-c8a5-46e4-8010-da83589dfe4e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#212121","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.23905.13510798883392466.27d26726-35b7-4adb-b312-9565997d7f38.c29e7d06-5eee-4ea1-bb2f-703b358a4335","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#212121","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.9,"RatingsCount":"41","PackageFamilyNames":["EasyTigerApps.FontCandy_dgwy3a3h02hc6"],"ContentIds":["81c81ddc-5a9f-d97b-b9b0-2b9e42c07855","eec94229-3048-c651-3f23-cc7d31e88204"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Easy Tiger, the creators of Split Pic, are happy to announce that Font Candy is now also available on Window!

When your PC is not shutdown properly, you will receive real-time notification on your phone and will be able to put your PC to sleep or hibernate.\r\nMoving to a new location and trying to set up a printer can be difficult. Using the WorkWise print feature, this problem is solved. Simply scan a designated QR code identifier on the desired HP printer and that printer’s drivers will be installed and configured seamlessly without you manually entering any printer information. \r\nImprove security, provide real-time PC updates, and easily download printer drivers with the HP WorkWise smartphone app. \r\n©Copyright 2016 HP Development Company, L.P.

Once it's activated, you can drag or swipe the terminal screen to view previous lines (scroll-back mode is automatically triggered by dragging or swiping in full window mode).\r\n- On-screen keyboard is activated when you tap the cursor in Mobile devices.\r\n- In Mobile devices, tapping a session tab and closing its popup menu without selecting any menu (ex. pressing the Back button) also activates the on-screen keyboard.\r\n- Some features are disabled or hidden for Windows 10 Mobile devices based on its available memory (ex. background option may not available on smartphones with less than 2GB of memory).\r\n\r\n// RECENT IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n- \"Clear Scrollback\" is added under the \"Terminal\" menu. If you want to save some previous lines, you can scroll back (SHIFT+UP) first and then select the menu; the text line buffer is cleared up to the currently visible top line.\r\n- ALT+SHIFT+P now takes a snapshot of a terminal window with its title bar and frame border. If you just want the content area, press ALT+P.\r\n- Layout Freezer is added for saving and restoring the layout of opened terminal windows\r\n- New cipher \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\" is added\r\n- TCP Direct connection method now supports TLS 1.2 encryption and can be used for directly connecting to HTTPS servers\r\n- More host key types are added: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, ssh-ed25519\r\n- More key exchange algorithms are added: curve25519-sha256@libssh.org, ecdh-sha2-nistp256, ecdh-sha2-nistp384, ecdh-sha2-nistp521, diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256\r\n- Now supports Bluetooth/RFCOMM communication. This feature can be handy when you're developing or debugging a custom Bluetooth service for IoT devices. For an example of such usage with Windows IoT on Raspberry Pi 2, please visit http://token2shell.com/howto/bluetooth-iot-sample\r\n- Proprietary printing mode (ESC[2016i) for directly previewing and printing a PDF file now supported (http://token2shell.com/howto/local-print)\r\n- Keyboard shortcuts CTRL+SHIFT+C and CTRL+SHIFT+V are added for copy and paste respectively\r\n- CTRL+SHIFT+A keyboard shortcut is added for selecting all buffered terminal lines; Token2Shell first enables its 'Find' text mode and then selects all text.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PDM81PN5VXL","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Coloring Book for Mandala - Adults Coloring Book","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41485.14151773113519261.0c063a9e-e941-4e4b-973d-507cdf0b5775.01ad7265-307a-4a59-bc50-a3be017c99e3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#B404AE","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29017.14151773113519261.0c063a9e-e941-4e4b-973d-507cdf0b5775.8c5af369-2421-44e9-9062-33a94b8b15de","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#B404AE","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24067.14151773113519261.0c063a9e-e941-4e4b-973d-507cdf0b5775.7213f81d-663b-40d5-a0ef-d40aeba7e3b3","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#B404AE","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45337.14151773113519261.0c063a9e-e941-4e4b-973d-507cdf0b5775.f0c22917-9ea1-44ec-812a-f56ce260dd43","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#B404AE","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5753.14151773113519261.0c063a9e-e941-4e4b-973d-507cdf0b5775.f8d54877-2e91-4342-a4cb-8e647a3829d1","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#B404AE","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30284.14151773113519261.0c063a9e-e941-4e4b-973d-507cdf0b5775.4c7c5dc5-89a7-4a81-bccb-eaba0deec993","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#B404AE","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34648.14151773113519261.0c063a9e-e941-4e4b-973d-507cdf0b5775.35261a85-3915-4471-85cf-ccb58a28c28f","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50701.14151773113519261.0c063a9e-e941-4e4b-973d-507cdf0b5775.2c0b847f-58a7-4c05-bae8-256db39bcaf1","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6060.14151773113519261.0c063a9e-e941-4e4b-973d-507cdf0b5775.39765ac6-be4f-4d62-a28e-fdf601a0e0b5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#B404AE","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.1,"RatingsCount":"7","PackageFamilyNames":["10414Kingloft.ColoringBookforMandala-AdultsColorin_hwg4vmr4pnwdp"],"ContentIds":["4e240da1-2d13-5659-57fd-d15faf825adf","f50ce036-744d-b29a-beaa-38a71059ae77"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The best app for coloring book therapy is now in the store!\r\nIt has all the beautiful illustrations, including mandala, floral and animals, along with many cool colorful palettes!

is the only free coloring app that lets you color with exactly the same feel as coloring pencils!  Relax on the couch and enjoy coloring a complex design, a vacation spot, or a crazy cartoon cat - tons of pages to choose from.  Even color the same picture more than once, to see what else you can do with it.  No need to worry about losing your coloring pencils in the couch anymore!\r\n\r\nThe app comes with one free coloring book, and other books are available as small in-app purchases.  Books are created by indie artists, so all of them have a unique feel and style.  New books are being added all the time, so keep checking back in the in-app store to see what's been published lately.  Half of the proceeds from every in app purchase goes directly to the artist, so keep 'em drawing if you like their stuff!\r\n\r\nColorist also works with a mouse, pen and touch.  Coloring with your finger is fine, but a pressure sensitive stylus is what Colorist was designed for and where it truly shines.  The app is fully functional in the free version - the only purchases are any extra coloring books you choose to buy.\r\n\r\nIf you're an artist and want to submit a book for colorist, reach out at submissions@factionapps.com.  We're always looking for awesome new pages!\r\n\r\nSome of the cool stuff:\r\n- No need to lug around a coloring book and manage a bunch of pencils - its all there on your tablet!\r\n- Blend, shade, and even erase (something your coloring pencils won't do!)\r\n- Automatically stay inside the lines - for when you're feeling impatient!\r\n- Support an indie artist and feel good!

Just select the length of text that you want to replace, say whatever you want to replace it with, and it's done! \r\n\r\nIn addition to most of vocabulary, Dictation App recognizes several commands that give you more control. Those are: New paragraph, new line, comma, exclamation mark, question mark and semi-colon. It also understands the text emoticons of Smiley, Frownie and Winkie. And this is just the Dictate & Edit screen.\r\n\r\nDictation App is also a handy text-to-speech tool. Any text that you generate or enter into the app, it can narrate back to you in the voice of whichever Cortana language you happen to be using. Each Cortana language comes with a female and male voice personality that sound more natural than synthetic. You can also vary the rate of the narration.\r\n\r\nThe Output screen of Dictation App lets you export the content that you have generated. There are several options. You can save it as a Text File, send it as Email with a file attachment to one or more contacts, send it as SMS with a file attachment to one or more contacts, or Share it with other apps that accept text content. You can also print the first page or save it as a PDF file.\r\n\r\nContent can also be saved as an RTF file that supports formatting and can be opened by Microsoft Word. The RTF editor is equipped with several buttons including Bold, Italic, Underline, Font-size, Font color, Highlight, Hyperlink, Left, Right and Center alignment.\r\n\r\nDictation App converts your spoken words into text in real time, with high accuracy and efficiency. You can correct any misunderstandings easily by selecting and repeating. Generating 500 word articles, 1000 word articles and even essays is an easier process because Writer's Block and analysis paralysis are no longer an issue.\r\n\r\nThis dictation software for Windows 10 has a free 24-hour trial period and then a price of $2.49. Try it out and see how many cool features it really packs. HasFocus.com listens to customer feedback so if a feature is missing, send us an email and let us know.

After the photo session is complete, users can experiment with image styles, border colors, corners, and backgrounds. Each image can also have a small time stamp. At the end of the process, the user can print and/or share the final product. Instant Photo Booth supports the Windows 8.1 print and sharing charms, as well as direct integration with Facebook and SkyDrive.\r\n\r\nInstant Photo Booth is also highly customizable. Suppose you are going to set up a photo booth as part of a fundraising event, or for your wedding guests. Wouldn’t it be great to customize the look? What if you could also customize the products so they became souvenirs of your event? Or suppose your event has so many people that you need to keep the session time as short as possible. Instant Photo Booth has extensive customization features that will allow you to do all of these things, and more.\r\n\r\nOn top of all these things, Instant Photo Booth has several optional features that make it comparable to professional photo booth software such as green screen (chroma key), guest book, idle-time slide show, and multiple monitor support.\r\n\r\nThe free version is fully functional, but has image watermarks.\r\n\r\n*USB webcams are not supported by Windows RT.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MV0LWS5D3PP","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Course For Pro Tools 103 Recording and Editing Audio","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10520.13798176729036960.3e451b3f-9c97-4253-a5fd-18cb46f15e64.38fa3022-24a2-4481-b5f2-dd4061abe4b2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60380.13798176729036960.3e451b3f-9c97-4253-a5fd-18cb46f15e64.3d17509d-608c-47fc-983c-c694bf4473c6","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24891.13798176729036960.3e451b3f-9c97-4253-a5fd-18cb46f15e64.794cbf74-a926-42f3-b1fb-78c8c259e8e2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54918.13798176729036960.3e451b3f-9c97-4253-a5fd-18cb46f15e64.b6945af9-e999-41ed-b777-c3a589e32d48","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14830.13798176729036960.3e451b3f-9c97-4253-a5fd-18cb46f15e64.ab3e3fb6-b1a5-4b86-bcfc-f850234e30eb","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36176.13798176729036960.3e451b3f-9c97-4253-a5fd-18cb46f15e64.9f8d8441-6534-402a-be38-76365bb6ab38","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53629.13798176729036960.3e451b3f-9c97-4253-a5fd-18cb46f15e64.10f6114c-a82b-4615-a489-6c84deedd62b","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$14.95","Price":14.95,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["AskVideo.com.CourseForProTools103RecordingandEditi_hxfbjjxnmyb4m"],"ContentIds":["054d63d0-f31c-7883-229c-4466bc953122","d612c9ce-5573-378e-6722-eb80c2085da1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Recording and editing audio with any DAW can be complex, and Pro Tools is no different.
