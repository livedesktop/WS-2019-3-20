My bird has a huge passion for mini golf but there are no golf clubs (sticks) and balls to play with, he has reinvented the game concept.\r\nHe blows up his clumsy body until he looks like a ball and uses a slingshot to move towards the hole.\r\nAfter the first shot the game play will change from slingshot modus to arrow modus with a power bar, for a more precise stroke.\r\nAdvice: Remember that the first hit will be the most difficult, so do not put too much strength in it because it will simply make our fluffy friend, fly out of the track. Don't hit the bird into the sea - it doesn't like to be a subsurfer...\r\n\r\nCool gamefeat:\r\n- Awesome 3D graphics\r\n- Cute animal characters and animations with dancing birds\r\n- 4 fun courses with over 70 holes\r\n- Simple, drag-and-release gameplay mechanic for the slingshot\r\n- Direction arrow with power bar for the successive stroke - just touch it\r\n- Realistic physics and ball movement\r\n- Collectible coins and jewels to increase your score\r\n- Easy and funny to play\r\n\r\nTry to find the shortest and easiest path to the hole in order to rise your score. Let's make it with no more than 3 par (hits) and you will get three stars.\r\nThere are also collectible coins and jewels that can increase your final score like crazy.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one gem you will get back one par (stroke) which means that you have higher possibilities to get 3 stars.\r\n\r\nEnjoy hours of fun with this challenging free app!

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too.

Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLXM8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Checkers (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41602.9007199266438309.19b8ebd8-67c1-404c-8bdc-a756a09d4b80.93358072-360d-435e-9900-8f43e07d501c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8409.9007199266438309.68711bb6-b3d7-4a45-85e7-a1356d611797.91a020b2-a58a-4d32-809e-95187d0976fc","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.CheckersFree_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["bb0ca58b-1784-7cd2-d894-45efe8ebf63d","8ea2cc5d-f4b8-30d5-08cc-b01012a67735"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Checkers played by two opponents, on opposite sides of a board, alternating moves. In a single player mode, person is always down (blue) regardless of who is moving first. Pieces move diagonally on the dark squares and opponents' pieces are captured by jumping over them to an unoccupied square. Capturing is mandatory. When multiple capture sequence is available, player may choose the sequence but have to make all available captures. When men reach the farthest row forward, they become kings, enabling them to move backwards. \r\nThere are three different modes: \r\n- English Draughts - pieces can't jump back and Kings can only move one stop in either direction. \r\n- Flying Kings - pieces can't jump back but Kings can can move as far as they want along unblocked diagonals (also known as Spanish, Czech, Argentinian, Thai, Turkish). \r\n- International - pieces can jump back and Kings can can move as far as they want along unblocked diagonals (also known as Brazilian, Russian shashki, Pool checkers). \r\n\r\nPieces are moved by first selecting (tap) the piece to move and then selecting (tap) the cell to move to. If there is only one available move for selected piece, it will move by automatically (no second tap needed). Alternatively you can tap on the destination without selecting the piece (if only one piece can reach it). Normally blocks are black, however blocks current player can move to are colored in dark green. Selected piece is marked by bright green border.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar).

Playing this game is rather simple: Move the bird on the twig by using your mouse or simply touching the screen. Once you have positioned the bird click below the twig and bird drop will start falling although not quite according to the laws of physics which I must admit. It is all about timing: You will get more points if you position the bird as far left as possible and if you hit the car close to the rear. If you trigger too early you can deploy a parachute slicing the speed of decent by half. This however will reduce the points you may gather by 50%. If you click a third time the parachute will disappear and the bird drop will fall at its original speed. But if you do so you will only collect 25% of the possible points. Not dropping at all will cost you 100 points from your cumulative score. A simple and fun game for kids! An absurd game for adults – if you are in the right mood...   ;-)\r\n(en-us, 1.1.0.9)","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDNB8X","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"*Mine Sweeper","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15312.9007199266466131.661d4b0e-803c-49e7-b98f-0b5013de50c0.d8362def-9d03-4ab5-98eb-feeb0caa2091","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61468.9007199266466131.661d4b0e-803c-49e7-b98f-0b5013de50c0.679cdeb7-d869-466a-8844-fe2829a2347a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["12291raymond.li.MineSweeper_szs6zaftcmqhc"],"ContentIds":["c7718f4d-5f26-212c-a165-8f3140fbc8fb","85580725-5af9-c764-de39-c2c8391f35a8","e5a7a738-b019-19fa-855e-e5591ad61a60"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"*MineSweeper is a deceptively simple test of memory and reasoning—and one of the most popular windows games of all time.

Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day.
